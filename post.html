<h1 class="title">Simulating an interactive Twitter graph</h1>
</header>
<p>This week I submitted some early work to a workshop co-located with EuroSys in Bordeaux, France. In the process of gathering data for my submission, I discovered some interesting things about simulating social network graphs that I thought Iâ€™d share more broadly.</p>
<h2 id="followers-following-power-law">Followers following power law</h2>
<p>Everyone knows the degree distribution of natural graphs follows a power law: most people have a handful of friends or followers (in my case, on the order of 0), while a handful of people (Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, Barack Obama) have many millions of followers. We know how to at least reproduce graphs with this same degree distribution with a class of synthetic graph generators known as Kronecker generators.</p>
